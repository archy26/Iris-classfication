MACHINE LEARNING WITH IRIS DATASET

Simple classification problem using logistic regression and SVM.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, 
and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
This is the first basic project for machine learning and accuracy can be improved using advanced classification algorithms.

Happy Machine Learning!
